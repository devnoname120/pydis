# pydis
**pydis** is an experiment to disprove some of the falsehoods about performance
and optimisation regarding software and interpreted languages in particular, **as long as the heavy work is done by calling native non-Python code**.

Below you will find a [Redis](https://github.com/antirez/redis/) clone,
**pydis**, written *in ~250 lines of idiomatic Python code* where the **parsing and threading are offloaded to native C code** for performance reasons. It provides a
subset of redis' functionality for which there are
[official benchmarks](https://redis.io/topics/benchmarks).

Briefly, **pydis** is ~50% as fast as Redis measured in number operations per
second.

P.S. This is not a criticism of Redis, which is a brilliant project and a 
system-level software that powers thousands of infrastructures. It just happened
to be one of the fastest software I could imagine *and* clone the same day.

## Disclaimer
I have used the following libraries written in C for performance:

- [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop)

  > uvloop is a fast, drop-in replacement of the built-in asyncio event loop. uvloop is implemented in Cython and uses libuv under the hood.
                                                    >
- [hiredis](https://pypi.org/project/hiredis/)

  > Python wrapper that calls hiredis which is written and C and performs all the parsing.

### Host System
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Python 3.8.5 (GCC 9.3.0)
- Redis 5.0.7 `malloc=jemalloc-5.2.1 bits=64 build=636cde3b5c7a3923`

## Contributions
Contributions are very welcome, given that they fall into one of the following
categories:

- Those that improve the performance.
  - The aim of this exercise is to prove that interpreted languages can be just
    as fast as C. So whilst using a faster parser in C with Python bindings is
    okay, rewriting **pydis** in [Cython](https://cython.org/) is not.
  - I will accept "minor" deviations from idioms only if the performance gains
    are worth it; stick to idiomatic Python otherwise!
- Those to achieve feature parity with Redis *for which there are official
  benchmarks*.
  - We are not trying to develop a full-featured Redis clone here so please do 
    not implement commands for which there are no official benchmarks.
- Those that fix formatting etc.
  - Please do not invent your own style, use PEP 8.
